*Code Refactor Homework*

# Changes in Tags to Semantic
I changed to semantic tags where I could, including: 
    1. adding <header> and <footer> 
    2. assigning the main image to a <section>
    3. changing the three main points (SEO, reputation, marketing) to <main>
    4. changing the benefits sidebar to an <aside>

# General Changes to HTML file
I changed the following:
    1. Changed the <title> to be more descriptive
    2. Added <id> to search-engine-optimization to make the link work
    3. Added <alt> tags to all images (except the board room image - section hero - I couldn't figure out how to do that since the image is in the CSS)
    4. Removed a superfluous closing <img> tag under the benefit cost section (on cost-management.png), since <img> is self-closing

# CSS Changes
I changed the following:
    1. Rearranged CSS style elements to reflect HTML layout (put in order: All-page styling, Header styling, Navigation styling, Main Image Section styling, Main styling, Aside styling, Footer styling)
    2. Combined styling elements in the Main and Aside sections; shared styling elements were combined so that - for example, we wanted to change the text color in all the Aside elements to purple - we would only need to change the color in one CSS style section, rather than three.
